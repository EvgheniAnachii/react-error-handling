# react-error-handling

`MyComponent` is an example of how try/catch can be used inside a `useEffect` hook.
Using error handling this way can become cumbersome since using this approach 
we have to wrap everything in order to catch errors.
We might use such error handling when it comes to requesting data from the server.
